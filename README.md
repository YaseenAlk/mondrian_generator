# mondrian_generator
A small python project for my MIT class (MAS.110). This program generates drawings in the style of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian (specifically in the style of his "Composition" works). Uses the pygame library for drawing.

Note: This is project is a WIP (work in progress). Code still needs to be cleaned up, and rectangles are not yet automatically filled with color.
